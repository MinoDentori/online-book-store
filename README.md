## Setup

To set up Bookstore Pro and start exploring the literary world, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Java, Maven, and your preferred IDE installed.
Configure the database settings in the application.properties file.
Run the application using your IDE or the command line.
Access the platform through your web browser.

## Challenges and Solutions
Understanding the project architecture:
It was the first time I encountered such a large-scale project. 
It was difficult to melt everything in place, to understand how each part is related to the other, 
and how to fit them together so that the puzzle comes together and forms a single picture.
Connecting Liquibase, writing scripts for automatic creation, updating tables, adding data to them:
The process of automatically creating tables occupies an important place in the algorithm of the application 
and is an important element of the life cycle of the application, 
so it was very important to understand this technology well. 
In my opinion, the most difficult thing was that the error made in the script 
cannot be corrected without dropping all the tables, and you have to write additional scripts for changes and corrections. 
It was an incentive to concentrate as much as possible, 
because IDE cannot point to your inaccuracy, and you can rely only on yourself.


## Possible improvements

At the moment, I am considering several possible improvements to the project, 
which will enrich its functionality, offering, at the same time, new challenges.
1. Connecting a system for receiving and processing electronic payments, such as Stripe. 
This modern technological solution will allow users to pay for orders quickly and safely.
2. Integration of Google API services for user authentication. 
This will significantly reduce the time between the first login to the application 
and the start of using the full functionality, which should encourage new users.
